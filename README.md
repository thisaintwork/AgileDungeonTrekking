# AgileDungeonTrekking
This is the repository for Fall CSCI-E71 for the Traveling Players project


We used Miro for weekly scrum meetings: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPK-7qnU=/


Our definition of ready is: 

User story has a clear, complete acceptance criteria

User story has a title

User story addresses a business need

We can measure the acceptance criteria

User story is small enough for implementation in the given time, but large enough to provide customer value

Infrastructure and development tools are ready

Meets the INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small & Testable) criteria
