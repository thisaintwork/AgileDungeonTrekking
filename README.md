**Rationale for Backlog Ordering**:
As the product owner, I ordered the baseline based on our interview with Lexi Player One. I took this approach so that we could get an early win with one of our stakeholders. 

**True User Stories for PBIs**
**1. Title:** Shape change options 
- **Opening & Details:** As a druid and I want to know which animals can I shape change into because the options change based on my level and character. There are size classes for the animals in D&D and I can only change into the animals that are a certain size. I also have to have seen the animal before either "in person" or through some kind of magic effect. Bascially I need to matching my level to the set of animals in the right size class that I have seen. We use the D&D 5e rules.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exists. The DMs and players can log into the website. The website had a section for animals. Animals have an image and descriptive text. Players can select and animal to see it's stats. Players can find and choose the right animal for a game scenario in 5 min. 

**2. Title:** Animal stats 
- **Opening & Details:** As a druid, once I have a set of animals to choose from, I want to know things like health, attacks (magic and melee), resistences, proficiencies etc because I need some idea of what I can do when I change into that animal. When I change into an animal, it replaces my druid character. I can change back to my druid at any time, then I will go back to the same character configuration I was at when I initiated the shape change. For example, if I had 35 of 48 health points available as a druid, when I shaped change I gain the full health points of the animal. When I change back to a druid, I return to 35 of 48 health points. Here is an example description of an animal:

- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exists. The DMs and players can log into the website. The website had a section for animals. Players can select an animal into which to shape change. The app will ask players to confirm their selection. When a player confirms their selection for shape change, the app replaces the player's character sheet with the animal's character sheet with armor class, hit points, speed, stats (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, & charisma), skills, attributes, and actions. When a player leaves animal form, they revert back to their original character sheet as it was at the time of their shape change. 

**3. Title:** Take notes 
- **Opening & Details:** As an inexperienced player, I want to take notes during the game so that I can remember the important things that happened during our session. Usually I write down enough notes to fill one side of an 8" x 11" piece of ruled paper. Instead, I would like to enter notes as I am playing.
-  **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exsists.  The DMs and players can log into the website. The website has a section for notes that will store at least 18,000 characters (including spaces) for each session played up to 1000 sessions. The note can be edited in real time. The notes can be accessed between game sessions.

**4. Title:** Share Notes 
- **Opening & Details:** As an inexperienced player, I want to share notes with my team so that we can share information. I don't want to change my friend's notes by mistake, but I want to be able to add comments.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exsists.  The DMs and players can log into the website. The website has a section for notes that will store at least 18,000 characters (including spaces) for each session played up to 1000 sessions. Players can see notes written by their team mates.  Notes are tagged with the author's name and a date-time stamp recording the last time the notes were edited. Players can add comments to other's notes. Comments are tagged with the tagged with the author's name and a date-time stamp recording the time of submission. A players can not change another player's notes.  

**5. Title:** Information about NPCs
- **Opening & Details:** As a player, I want to track which NPCs we meet and why they are important so I can use the information in future sessions. It would be nice if I could find the proper spelling of the NPCs name and an image of them as well, because that will help me remember. I only need to enter a few sentences for each NPC, but I may want to add more information over time. 
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exsists.  The DMs and players can log into the website. Website has a section for NPC information that can store at least 1000 NPCs with at least 5 MB of image data and 18,000 character of text for each NPC (including spaces). DM and the players can add text and upload one image file to the NPC section. Uploaded images are displayed above associated text. DM and players can edit their own notes at any time. DMs and players can not change other's notes. 

**6. Title:** Match NPCs to Quests 
- **Opening & Details:** As a player, I want to track which NPCs gave me quests, so that I know where to bring the quest items and information once they are aquired. My group usually works on multiple texts at a time, so we can get confused. It would be nice to be able to tag quest items with the quest name, delivery location, and recieving NPC/entity. Sometimes we carry quest items for multiple sessions and I don't want to sell them by mistake. 
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exsists.  The DMs and players can log into the website. The website has a section for quests. The website has a section for NPCs. The website allows players to link each NPC to one or more quests. Each NPC is associated with one or more locations, quests, and/or quest items.

**7. Title: Track party loot and gold**
- **Opening & Details:** As a party, someone needs to keep track of party loot and gold, so we can efficiently share items and buy goods. Sometimes my party will swap gear before an encounter so we have the right armor, weapons, and spell items for the next challenge.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exsists.  The DMs and players can log into the website. The website has a section for party loot that will store a table up to 5,000 rows and 100 columns where each cell can hold at least 500 characters of text.

**8. Title:** Quest names & steps 
- **Opening & Details:** As a party, all players must know quests names and steps so that we have a common understanding of the game status. I like to take notes on quests each time we complete a step or get information related to the quest. 
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exsists.  The DMs and players can log into the website. The website has a section for quests that will store at least 3,600 characters (including spaces) for each quest up to 500 quests . Each quest has a name, and is tagged with a start location, end location, and associated NPC/entity for delivery. The website allows players to link each quest to one or more NPCs. 

**9. Title:** Track progress against quests 
- **Opening & Details:** Sometimes our party forgets which steps we still have to accomplish to get a quest done. I'd like to check off quest steps when we complete them, and also know what quests we have already done.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exsists.  The DMs and players can log into the website. The website had a section for quests taht will store. The DM and the players can enter quest names. Players can enter quest steps. Players can mark steps complete. Once all of the quest steps are complete, the quest name is automatically marked complete. The DM can delete quest names and steps. The players can delete quest steps, but not quest names. 

**10. Title:** Track party movement 
- **Opening & Details:** As a player, I need to know where I am in the D&D world. Usually, we have to travel to different locations to accomplish quest items. If we know where we are on the “world” map, then we can plan the best route and order of our quest steps much easier. Sometimes we split the party and go to different locations and need to plan where we will meet up again.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exsists.  The DMs and players can log into the website. The website has a section for maps. DM can load map files onto the website. DM can place player tokens on one or more maps. Players can see the maps that the DM has loaded on the website. Players can see all tokens that the DM has placed on the maps. Players can not move tokens. 

**11. Title:** Special party rules 
- **Opening & Details:** As a player, I want to have a website where I can find the special party rules that the DM created for my campaign. I sometimes forget these rules and they are not in any books or on the internet because they are only being used by our team. I need to know the rules so I can take advantage of them.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exists. The DMs and players can log into the website. The website has a section for party rules. The DM can enter and save the special party rules. The DM can edit and resave the rules as many times as they want. Players can read the special party rules.

**Estimating**
- PBIs have been estimated in Github using story points. Story points can be found in each PBI on the right-hand side under “show all fields”.
- Our team conducted an “affinity estimating” activity. The results of this activity can be found in Github under the Affinity Estimating tab.
- As a side note: Only developers participated in estimating PBIs.
