# AgileDungeonTrekking
This is the repository for Fall CSCI-E71 for the Traveling Players project


We used Miro for weekly scrum meetings: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPK-7qnU=/


Our definition of ready is: 
o	User story has a clear, complete acceptance criteria
o	User story has a title
o	User story addresses a business need
o	We can measure the acceptance criteria
o	User story is small enough for implementation in the given time, but large enough to provide customer value
o	Infrastructure and development tools are ready
o	Meets the INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small & Testable) criteria
