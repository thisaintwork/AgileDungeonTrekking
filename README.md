**True User Stories for PBIs**
**1. Shape change options** 
- **Story**: As a druid and I want to know which animals can I shape change into because the options change based on my level and character. There are size classes for the animals in D&D and I can only change into the animals that are a certain size. I also have to have seen the animal before either "in person" or through some kind of magic effect. Bascially I need to matching my level to the set of animals in the right size class that I have seen. We use the D&D 5e rules.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: I can find and choose the right animal for the game scenario in 5 min. 

**2. Animal stats** 
- **Story**: As a druid, once I have a set of animals, I want to know things like health, attacks (magic and melee), resistences, proficiencies etc because I need some idea of what I can do when I change into that animal. When I change into an animal, it replaces my druid character and I only have the animal's stats. I can change back to my druid at any time, then I will go back to the same stats I was as a druid. Here is an example description of an animal:

- **Acceptance Criteria**: When I shape change, the tool shows me the animal's armor class, hit points, speed, stats (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, & charisma), skills, attributes, and actions.

**3. Take notes** 
- **Story**: As an inexperienced player, I want to take notes during the game so that I can remember the important things that happened during our session. Usually I write down enough notes to fill one side of an 8" x 11" piece of ruled paper. Instead, I would like to enter notes as I am playing.
-  **Acceptance Criteria**: The product has a notes section that will store at least 2 pages of notes for each session played up to 1000 sessions. The note can be edited in real time. The notes can be accessed between game sessions.

**4. Share Notes** 
- **Story**: As an inexperienced player, I want to share notes with my team so that we can share information. I don't want to change my friend's notes by mistake, but I want to be able to add comments.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Players can see notes written by their team mates.  Notes are tagged with the author's name and a date-time stamp recording the last time the notes were edited. Players can add comments to other's notes. Comments are tagged with the tagged with the author's name and a date-time stamp recording the time of submission. A players can not change another player's notes.  

**5. Information about NPCs**
- **Story:** As a player, I want to track which NPCs we meet and why they are important so I can use the information in future sessions. It would be nice if I could find the proper spelling of the NPCs name and an image of them as well, because that will help me remember. I only need to enter a few sentences for each NPC, but I may want to add more information over time. 
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 

**6. Match NPCs to Quests** 
- **Story**: I want to know which NPCs gave me quests FINISH ME 
- **Acceptance Criteria**

**7. Track party loot and gold**
- **Story**: Someone needs to keep track of party loot and gold FINISH ME 
- **Acceptance Criteria**

**8. Quest names & steps** 
- **Story**: I want everyone to know quests names and steps FINISH ME 
- **Acceptance Criteria**

**9. Track progress against quests** 
- **Story**: Sometimes our party forgets which steps we still have to accomplish to get a quest done. I'd like to check off quest steps when we complete them, and also know what quests we have already done.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**

**10. Track party movement** 
- **Story**: As a player, I need to know where I am in the D&D world. Usually, we have to travel to different locations to accomplish quest items. If we know where we are on the “world” map, then we can plan the best route and order of our quest steps much easier. Sometimes we split the party and go to different locations and need to plan where we will meet up again.
- **Acceptance Criteria**

**11. Special party rules** 
- **Story**: As a player, I want to have a website where I can find the special party rules that the DM created for my campaign. I sometimes forget these rules and they are not in any books or on the internet because they are only being used by our team. I need to know the rules so I can take advantage of them.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A website exists. The DMs and players can log into the website. The DM can enter and save the special party rules. The DM can edit and resave the rules as many times as they want. Players can read the special party rules.
