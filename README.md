**True User Stories for PBIs**
1. Shape change options - I am a druid and I need to know which animals can I shape change into based on my level and character. There are size classes for the animals in D&D and I can only change into the animals that are a certain size. I also have to have seen the animal before either "in person" or through some kind of magic effect. Bascially I need to matching my level to the set of animals in the right size class that I have seen.
2. Animal stats - Once I have a set of animals, I need some idea of what I can do when I change into that animal. I need to know things like health, attacks (magic and melee), resistences, proficiencies etc.
3. Take notes -  I want to take notes during the game. FINISH ME
4. Share notes - Players need to read and edit notes between game sessions FINISH ME
5. Information about NPCs - I forget which NPCs we met and why they are important FINISH ME
6. Match NPCs to Quests - I want to know which NPCs gave me quests FINISH ME
7. Track party loot and gold - Someone needs to keep track of party loot and gold FINISH ME
8. Quest names & steps - I want everyone to know quests names and steps FINISH ME
9. Track progress against quests -  Sometimes our party forgets which steps we still have to accomplish to get a quest done. I'd like to check off quest steps when we complete them, and also know what quests we have already done. 
10. Track party movement - As a player, I need to know where I am in the D&D world. Usually, we have to travel to different locations to accomplish quest items. If we know where we are on the “world” map, then we can plan the best route and order of our quest steps much easier. Sometimes we split the party and go to different locations and need to plan where we will meet up again.
11. Special party rules - I forget the special party rules that the DM created for our campaign. They are not in any books or on the internet because they are only being used by our team. I need to know the rules so I can take advantage of them.
